> A WIP Rust BLE stack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonas-schievink/rubble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonas-schievink/rubble)

This will hopefully eventually become a BluetoothÂ® Low Energy compatible
protocol stack.

**NOTE: None of this has passed the Bluetooth Qualification Process, so it must
not be used in commercial products!**
