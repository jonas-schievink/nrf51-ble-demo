//! Implementation of the Attribute Protocol (ATT).
//!
//! ATT always runs over L2CAP channel `0x0004`, which is connected by default as soon as the
//! Link-Layer connection is established.
//!
//! ATT is used by GATT, the *Generic Attribute Profile*, which introduces the concept of *Services*
//! and *Characteristics* which can all be accessed and discovered over the Attribute Protocol.
//!
//! # Attributes
//!
//! The ATT server hosts a list of *Attributes*, which consist of the following:
//!
//! * A 16-bit *Attribute Handle* ([`Handle`]) uniquely identifying the attribute.
//! * A 16- or 128-bit UUID identifying the attribute type. This provides information about how to
//!   interpret the attribute's value (eg. as a little-endian 32-bit integer).
//! * The attribute's *value*, consisting of a dynamically-sized byte array of up to 512 Bytes.
//! * A set of *permissions*, restricting the operations that can be performed on the attribute.
//!
//! ## Attribute Grouping
//!
//! The higher-level protocol layer using ATT (ie. GATT) may define a set of attribute types as
//! *Grouping Attributes*. These attribute types are allowed for use in *Read By Group Type*
//! requests, and can also influence the behavior of other requests (such as *Find By Type Value*).
//!
//! All *Grouping Attributes* can be seen as the start of a group of attributes. Groups are formed
//! by indicating the *Group End Handle* to the client, which is the handle of the last attribute in
//! the group. The *Group End Handle* isn't known by the ATT server and must be provided by the
//! higher-level protocol (GATT).
//!
