//! An experimental BLE stack.
//!
//! Tries to adhere to the *Bluetooth Core Specification v4.2* (at least for now).
//!
//! # Using the stack
//!
//! Rubble is runtime and hardware-agnostic: It does not need an RTOS (although you can certainly
//! use one if you want) and provides hardware interfaces that need to be implemented once for
//! every supported MCU family.
//!
//! The only part that interacts directly with platform-specific interfaces is [`link`], Rubble's
//! BLE Link-Layer implementation. You have to provide it with a few hardware-specific services:
//! * A microsecond-precision [`Timer`].
//! * A [`Transmitter`] that can send data and advertising channel packets.
//! * A processor for `link::Cmd`, which tells the support code when to call Rubble's functions
//!   again.
